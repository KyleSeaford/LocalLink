## Developing Robot Psql Backup

The robot will back up the Postgres database every day to
\\192.168.127.56\GarrysPool\samba\LocalLinkk\Backups\Database


### Creating the Cron Script

The bash script to set up a cron job that will run the Python script /var/www/fask/Locallinkk/Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\robot_psql_backup.py every day at 1 minute past midnight.

#### Steps to Use the Script

- Save the Script: Save the script to a file, for example, setup_cron.sh. The script is in the file.
[Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\setup_cron](Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\setup_cron)

- Make the Script Executable: Make the script executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x setup_cron.sh
```

- Run the Script: Execute the script to set up the cron job:

```bash
./setup_cron.sh
```

#### Explanation

Define the Cron Job Command:

```bash
CRON_JOB="1 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /var/www/robot_psql_backup.py"
```

This sets the cron job to run the Python script every day at 00:01 (1 minute past midnight).

Check if the Cron Job Exists:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null | grep -F "$CRON_JOB")
```

This command lists the current cron jobs and checks if our desired job already exists.

Add the Cron Job if it Does Not Exist:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "$CRON_JOB") | crontab -
```

If the job does not exist, it appends the new cron job to the current crontab.

Confirmation Message:

```bash
echo "Cron job added: $CRON_JOB"
```

Prints a message to confirm that the cron job has been added.

This script ensures that the cron job is added without duplicating entries if it already exists.


## Todo

- [x] Test backup script
- [x] run script to create cron job
- [x] Test email notification, bad db change pass, bad garry change output path
- [x] Mount Garry /mnt/garry/LocalLinkk/Backups/Database

- [x] Change .env to backup to garry, setting backupOutputPath
- [x] Finish read me Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\readme.md

# Development Notes from 1st July 2024

- Changed colors on help page
- Refined content on help page 

- Changed the image change endpoint to accept and decode base64 then save as a jpg:
```python
@api.route("/users/imageChange/<string:id>", doc={"description": "Changes the image of a user by ID"})
class Users(Resource):
    parserImage = reqparse.RequestParser()
    parserImage.add_argument('image', type=str, required=True, help='Base64 encoded image string')

    @api.doc(parser=parserImage)
    def put(self, id):
        logging.debug(f"Changing image by ID {id}")
        data = self.parserImage.parse_args()
        image_data = data['image']
        
        try:
            # Ensure the image data is properly formatted
            if ',' in image_data:
                header, image_data = image_data.split(',', 1)
            
            # Decode the base64 string
            image_data = base64.b64decode(image_data)
            
            # Create directory if it doesn't exist
            image_dir = f"profilePictures/{id}"
            if not os.path.exists(image_dir):
                os.makedirs(image_dir)
                
            # Save the image
            image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, 'profilePicture.jpg')
            with open(image_path, 'wb') as image_file:
                image_file.write(image_data)
                
            logging.debug(f"Image changed and saved to {image_path}")
            return {'message': 'Image changed'}, 200
            
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error changing image: {e}")
            return {'message': 'Failed to change image', 'error': str(e)}, 500     
```

- Can change the image on the backend by using hte users id and the url that is console logged on hte profile page however cant actually change it due to several issues
