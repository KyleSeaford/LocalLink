## Developing Robot Psql Backup

The robot will back up the Postgres database every day.

### Creating the Cron Script

The bash script to set up a cron job that will run the Python script /var/www/fask/Locallinkk/Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\robot_psql_backup.py every day at 1 minute past midnight.

#### Steps to Use the Script

- Save the Script: Save the script to a file, for example, setup_cron.sh. The script is in the file.
[Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\setup_cron](Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\setup_cron)

- Make the Script Executable: Make the script executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x setup_cron.sh
```

- Run the Script: Execute the script to set up the cron job:

```bash
./setup_cron.sh
```

#### Explanation

Define the Cron Job Command:

```bash
CRON_JOB="1 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /var/www/robot_psql_backup.py"
```

This sets the cron job to run the Python script every day at 00:01 (1 minute past midnight).

Check if the Cron Job Exists:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null | grep -F "$CRON_JOB")
```

This command lists the current cron jobs and checks if our desired job already exists.

Add the Cron Job if it Does Not Exist:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "$CRON_JOB") | crontab -
```

If the job does not exist, it appends the new cron job to the current crontab.

Confirmation Message:

```bash
echo "Cron job added: $CRON_JOB"
```

Prints a message to confirm that the cron job has been added.

This script ensures that the cron job is added without duplicating entries if it already exists.


## Todo

[x] Test backup script
[x] run script to create cron job
[ ] Test email notification, bad db change pass, bad garry change output path
[ ] Mount Garry
[ ] Change .env to backup to garry, setting backupOutputPath
[ ] Finish read me Robots\RobotPsqlBackup\readme.md
