# Development Notes from 24th June 2024

- created users endpoints `endpoint_users.py`
- Needed to import `from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, get_jwt, jwt_required, create_access_token
from flask import request, make_response` for verification in `endpoint_users.py`

- need to create token in `endpoint_users.py`:
```python
authorizations = {
    'Token': {
        'type': 'apiKey',
        'in': 'header',
        'name': 'Authorization'
    }
}
```
- Had to change app.config() to include the jwt_secret_key and JWTManager in `application.py`:
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET_KEY') # make sure to change this in .env file
jwt = JWTManager(app) 
CORS(app)  # Allow CORS for all routes
```

- Had to change app.config() to include the jwt_secret_key and JWTManager in `endpoint_users.py`:
```python
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET_KEY') # make sure to change this in .env file
jwt = JWTManager(app) 

api = Api(app, authorizations=authorizations, security='Token')
```

- need to include `JWT_SECRET_KEY=secret` in `.env`
- personal .env
```env
logFilename=c:\temp\linkk.log
logLevel=DEBUG
logFormat=%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
databaseFilename=I:\CODE\LocalLinkk\Backend\categories.db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=secret
```
- .env.example
```env
logFilename=/var/www/fask/log/application.log
logLevel=DEBUG
logFormat=%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s
databaseFilename=/var/www/fask/localLinkk.db
projectPath=/var/www/fask/LocalLinkk/Backend
JWT_SECRET_KEY=secret
```

## Connecting to Frontend 
- Can log in with the login page 
- Can sign up with the sign up page 

- Locations displayed in the location dropdown are the locations from all the users 
- Dropdowns (location and catagories) have a search bar
- The dropdowns (location and catagories) now have a size limit when over they can be scrolled 
- Added icons to dropdown search bars 

- changed the localstore too asyncstore so it works on different devices 
- import asyncstorage at the top of a js file 
```bash
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
```
- To use, on the web it will appear in the localStore 
```javascript
await AsyncStorage.setItem('token', data.access_token);
```

## STUCK ON
- NEED TO - make it so emails in the database have to be different - easy
- Stuck trying to navigate from login / sign up too home page 
```bash
I:\CODE\LocalLinkk\Fâ€¦signupbuttons.js:66 The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {"name":"LocalLinkk - Home"} was not handled by any navigator.

Do you have a screen named 'LocalLinkk - Home'?

If you're trying to navigate to a screen in a nested navigator, see https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators#navigating-to-a-screen-in-a-nested-navigator.

This is a development-only warning and wont be shown in production.
