# To deploy LocalLinkk, there are several options available, including:

- Vercel: Known for its ease of use and excellent support for front-end frameworks.
- Heroku: A popular choice for full-stack applications with simple deployment workflows.
- AWS (Amazon Web Services): Offers robust, scalable solutions with extensive features but can be complex to set up.
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Provides a wide range of services and strong integration with other Google products.
- Microsoft Azure: Great for enterprise-level applications with extensive documentation and support.
- DigitalOcean: A cost-effective solution for deploying and managing virtual servers.

Given my experience with deploying on Vercel, we will use that platform for LocalLinkk. 
Vercel provides an efficient and streamlined deployment process, ensuring that our app is hosted with optimal performance and reliability.
